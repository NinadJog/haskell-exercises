# Pigeonhole Problem
This repo contains Haskell solutions to several short problems.

I have gathered them in a single repo because none of the problems is big enough to warrant its own repo.

Each problem has its own documentation; all the docs appear in the [docs/](docs) folder. The links to the documentation and the code appear in the following table.

Solutions in other languages will appear in their own repos but the links to them will appear in the following table. The repos for other languages will follow the same naming convention. For example, the Scala repo will be named scala-exercises, the Elixir repo will be named elixir-exercises, etc. 

| # | Exercise | Haskell | Scala |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Pigeonhole](docs/pigeonhole.md) | [Code](pigeonhole.hs) | [Code](https://github.com/NinadJog/scala-exercises/blob/main/Pigeonhole.scala) |

### Usage

You can of course clone the repo if you like, but if you are interested only in specific problems and their solutions, it might be worthwhile to download just those.

A few test cases for each problem appear in the comments.
