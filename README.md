# haskell-exercises
This repo contains the Haskell solutions to several short problems.

I have gathered all of them here in a single repo as none of the problems is big enough to warrant being placed in its own repo. Each problem has its own documentation and all of the docs appear in the [docs](docs) folder. The links to the documentation and the code appear in the following table.

Solutions in other languages will appear in their own repos but the the links to them will appear in the following table. The naming convention for the repos in other languages will follow the same naming convention. For example, the Scala repo will be named scala-exercises, etc. 

| Number | Exercise | Haskell | Scala |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Pigeonhole](docs/pigeonhole.md) | [Pigeonhole.hs](pigeonhole.hs) | TBD |
